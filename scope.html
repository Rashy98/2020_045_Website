                    A wide range of research is being performed around the world in response to the various challenges that have arisen as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These research mostly use IoT for their innovations due its popularity in the current world. Some of these studies are discussed in this section of this paper. 
                    <br><br>

                    DacNhuong Le et al. [2] introduce a novel IoT-enabled Depth-wise separable convolution neural network (DWS-CNN) with Deep support vector machine (DSVM) for COVID-19 diagnosis and classification in their article. The proposed DWS-CNN model incorporates a collection of processes, including data acquisition, Gaussian filtering (GF) based preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification, to detect both binary and multiple classes of COVID-19. Initially, patient data is acquired via IoT devices and transferred to a cloud server during the data collecting stage. Furthermore, the GF approach is used to remove any noise that may be present in the image. Similar to [2], T. Ozturk et al. [6] present a new approach for automatic COVID-19 identification using raw chest X-ray pictures. The suggested approach is designed to offer diagnostics for both binary and multi-class classification in identifying COVID, pneumonia and no findings. This system uses DarkNet technology for accurate predictions of convolutional layers. The purpose of this study is to see if radiology can be used to verify the scan method. The heatmaps generated by automated models were evaluated by radiologists. Fivefold cross-validation was utilized to test the functionality of the newly built method. The highest level of accuracy has been obtained and reported for both binary and multiclass categorization. 
                    <br><br>
 

                    Similar to DacNhoung Le et al., a real-time COVID-19 detection and monitoring system is proposed by Otoom et al. [3] in their work. This system employs an Internet of Things (IoTs) framework that uses wearable devices to collect real-time symptom data from users in order to identify suspected coronavirus cases as early as possible, as well as machine learning techniques to monitor the treatment response of those who have already recovered from the virus and to get a better understand of the virus's nature by collecting and analyzing relevant data. The paper CIoTVID, co-authored by A. Ramallo-González, A. González-Vidal, and A. Skarmeta [5], also offers an integrated approach based on IoT technologies that can act as opportunistic health data gathering agents for combatting the COVID-19 pandemic. This system uses an intelligent bot for the preliminary diagnosis of the patients where the bot collects the data using IoT devices. S. Karmore et al. [7] designed a Medical Diagnose Humanoid (MDH) that uses a mobile robotic system to do a complete diagnostic test to see if a person is infected with COVID-19. The data provided by the humanoid's sensors was combined with real-time data sensing and processed using machine learning. The system processes blood samples, X-rays, and sensory input from the test subject using machine learning techniques. It has sensors that determine body temperature and respiratory rate, such as a temperature sensor and an Airflow breathing sensor. Both of these sensors must be in contact with the patient. Moreover, Amani Kallel and her colleagues [8] have created a bespoke framework for COVID - 19 monitoring and prediction. The framework, according to the authors, incorporates hardware devices that might be medical devices like real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), X-ray machines like CT scans, or non-medical devices like wearable devices, drones, and so on. Another study by Cacovean et al. [9] uses a wearable device to collect and monitor a person's temperature and heart rate for a week. To evaluate whether the person is suspected of being infected with the Coronavirus, machine learning techniques are employed to examine the collected data. Furthermore, in their study, Hamid Mukhtar et al. [10] used a similar strategy of using wearable gadgets to determine potential suspects. The hardware component, according to the authors, is made up of two parts: one that wraps around the arm and the other that goes around the person's throat. 
                    <br><br>
  

                    Other than identifying potential patients, some studies are carried out to minimize the spread of the virus among people. Petrovic and Kocic [11] created a cheap IoT-based system to improve COVID-19 indoor safety by measuring temperature, identifying face masks, and assessing social distancing. To achieve the aforementioned objectives, they are employing non-contact methods. To achieve contactless temperature measurement, they employ an Arduino Uno with an infrared sensor or a thermal camera, while mask detection and social distancing checks are performed using computer vision techniques on a camera-equipped Raspberry Pi. The next section of this research compares and contrasts already available approaches for identifying probable COVID-19 patients with the suggested system in this study. 
                    <br><br>

                    Since SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus strain, there was no effective IoT-based solution available at the start of the outbreak. The approaches for identifying COVID-19 patients, such as PCR and Rapid Antigen testing, were not appropriate in all cases. As a result, many public venues and organizations have begun to monitor body temperature in order to identify potential COVID-19 infected persons and thereby control the disease's spread. With the appearance of COVID-19 positive individuals who showed no signs of elevated body temperature, the method's validity was called into question. Researchers devised numerous techniques and devices to provide a superior replacement for the current methodology. Yet, most of them are not better enough to control the disease. 
                    <br><br>

                    According to DacNhuong Le and his colleague’s research (A [2]), they employed an X-ray-based approach to differentiate COVID-19 positives. According to the authors, they collected patient data using IoT devices and then uploaded it to a cloud server. Similar concept of using X-ray images have adopted by the T. Ozturk et al (D [6]) in their research as well. Both These systems will not be suitable for daily use in an organization because of the usage of X-ray medium. Aside from that, the operational costs and influence on personnel may produce a slew of other issues at an organizational level. 
                    <br><br>

                    Otoom et al. present a new technique to pre-identify probable COVID-19 infected patients in their study (B [3]). According to the authors, they have used a wearable device to read the individuals. These data are then transferred to a cloud server for irregularities to be detected. The research (F [9]) by Cacovean et al. also followed a similar methodology of employing wearable devices. Even though both the methodologies maintain a contactless approach in finding potential COVID-19 positive persons, it can assist in a variety of unforeseen organizational situations. It's possible that not every employee has a wearable gadget. As a result, the system is unable to monitor such individuals, potentially spreading the virus to others.

                  A. Ramallo-González, A. González-Vidal, and A. Skarmeta's designed smart robot (C [5]) is a unique IoT-based solution for controlling disease spread. The robot has improved the contactless approach of identifying positive people by allowing them to be monitored remotely. As a result, this system would be perfect for monitoring patients in COVID-19 wards of hospitals. However, due to the nature of mobility, this will not be suitable for an organization. 
                </p>
                 
                <p>
                  S. Karmore et al. (E [7]) used robots to distinguish COVID-19 positive persons in their study. The authors claim to have employed "extreme testing" such as blood tests and X-ray pictures. Apart from that, the authors have said that the system's sensors must be in direct contact with the test subject. As a result, this technique fails to address the contactless approach and, due to the utilization of rigorous testing, will not be suitable for an organization. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  According to Amani Kallel and her colleagues' research (G [8]), using hardware components that may be medical equipment, such as real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), makes the system much more complex and difficult to manage. As a result, companies may face a slew of other issues when it comes to controlling and maintaining the device.
                </p>
                 
                <p>
                  When it comes to Hamid Mukhtar et al (H [10]) created approach, they used a similar notion of wearable gadgets to distinguish COVID-19 positive persons. The device should be worn around the arm and throat, according to the authors, which is in violation of the contactless approach. As a result, this approach is unsuitable for virus control at the organizational level. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  Furthermore, Petrovic and Kocic have investigated and created a low-cost IoT-based solution (I [11]) to monitor if persons adhere to government-imposed laws such as wearing a face mask and maintaining a social distance. This technique can be used to see if employees are following the rules, but it is not reliable enough to detect those who may be infected with COVID-19. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  When the foregoing facts are considered, it is evident that no adequate system has yet been developed to replace the current practice of monitoring body temperature to identify probable COVID-19 infected persons at an organizational level. As a result, the InCov chamber was created to be used at the entrance of any organization while addressing the aforementioned challenges. The above explanations are summarized in the table below.

                <a>Research Problem</a>
              </h2>

              <div class="entry-content">
                <p>Sri Lanka is a developing country where frequently uses the traditional method in the educational infrastructure. Traditional education has 
                  failed to transform itself in order to be relevant for today’s rapidly changing requirements hence the e-learning industry is still in its infancy 
                  in Sri Lanka. A recent study done to study the “attitude towards e-learning among second year medical students of the Faculty of Medicine, Colombo 
                  (n=138)” has shown that even with “93.5% of the students owning a computer, and 95% of them having internet connection, the use of ICT for educational 
                  purposes was low (51.7%).” But, with a robust infrastructure for digital access, e-learning will eventually play a vital role in shaping the skills 
                  and education needs of our country, as much as it does for developed countries in the world. </p> 

                  <p>But a few problems are at hand, as to why students are 
                  reluctant or nervous to use e-learning. According to recent studies conducted in Sri Lanka and in Bangladesh, both developing countries in the South 
                  Asian region, there are a few major challenges faced by students when using elearning systems. The first of them, is taking responsibility for their 
                  own learning. This is said to be difficult because they don’t trust their own competence. And they believe that they learn less when they learn by 
                  themselves. This feeling of not trusting your own learning ability is probably due to high teacher dependency.” In other words, not having a teacher 
                  present in the elearning system, the lack of frequent discussion with teachers was regarded as a problem. </p>

                  <p>The other major problem was that the 
                  students did not know, how to learn. They (the students) do not always know where to find the relevant resources or what to learn. Neither do they 
                  know how to navigate nor do they know how to sort out what is important out of all the expected reading. Other problems include the lack of flexibility, 
                  not knowing how to manage time and poorly organized administration.

                  <p> Therefore, we have identified that, even with the computer literacy and internet 
                  access has been rapidly growing in Sri Lanka for the past few years, more than one out of four person (age 5-69)computer literate in Sri Lanka, more 
                  than 2 out of five people (aged 5-69) digital literate, with the lack of student- tutor communication and students not knowing how and what to study, 
                  had been especially reducing the students of Sri Lanka from using the e-learning experience. </p>

              <div class="entry-content">
                <p>To construct an intelligent chamber which is more efficient and precise than the existing method of checking only the body temperature used in identifying possible COVID-19 infected individuals at the entrance of a considered organization, by evaluating the symptoms, fever, cough, anosmia, and shortness of breath.  </p>
              </div>

              <h2 class="entry-title">
                <a>• Specific Objectives </a>
              </h2>

              <div class="entry-content">
                <p>The main focus of this section is on the secondary objectives that can be either specific or different to each 
                  component related to the product. Although they are described under the secondary objectives section, it is really important 
                  to keep in mind that these conditions should also function accordingly in order for the complete system to run. 
                  Also to ensure that the assumptions made during the project development period.</p>

                <p><ol>
                <b> <li>Identifying the person </li> </b><br>
                  Two subcomponents make up the person identification component. When a person enters the chamber, the system detects them and begins the recognizing process. To identify the person, the system employs two methods. The face recognition and voice recognition systems identify people and authorize the testing process to begin. Initially, the system uses face recognition to identify the person. If no match is found, the system starts the voice recognition process to identify the person. The purpose of identifying individuals who enter the chamber is to keep a record of their test results for further evaluations. 
                </p>
                <b> <li>Fever Detection  </li> </b><br>
                <p>
                  The fever detection subcomponent is critical because 99% of symptomatic individuals have fever. The primary goal of fever detection is to check body temperature using a non-contact approach. A thermal camera is used in this system to measure the body temperature. When a person enters the chamber, the thermal camera automatically captures a thermal image. To classify the numerical value of the thermal image, the KNN classifier algorithm is used. The final result is generated in a matter of seconds. 
                </p>
                <b> <li>Anosmia Condition</li> </b><br>
                <p>
                  The main goal of this sub-component is to identify anosmia by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to compare the value of the person's given answer to the questions asked with the reading value of the fragrance inside the chamber. The system will ask a few questions regarding the odor within the chamber when the person enters. Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods are used to classify the recorded audio clips after the responses are captured using the microphone. The obtained results will be compared to the saturation level to see whether the person is a COVID-19 suspect or not.
                </p>
                <b> <li>Cough detection and cough resemblance  </li> </b><br>
                <p>
                  The primary purpose of this subsystem is to identify people by utilizing audio processing and transfer learning with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to assess whether the acquired forced cough is compatible with the forced cough of COVID-19 patients. Regardless of whether the person is asymptomatic or symptomatic, the audio clip acquired from the individual's force-cough within the chamber with the usage of a microphone will be used to determine if the person is a potential COVID-19 suspect or not with a confidence level. This component of the system contains two sub-components. For both these components, the system should be able to record an audio of 5 seconds. Next, the system should be able to create a spectrogram for the audio acquired. Then the system should be able to detect if the acquired audio contains a cough or not. After that, if the audio contains a cough, then the system should be able to detect if the cough is a COVID-19 positive cough or not.  
                </p>
                <b> <li>Shortness of Breath Detection  </li> </b><br>
                <p>
                  The component Shortness of Breath detection's purpose is to identify possible COVID-19 positive individuals using a contactless approach. The system aims to start the testing process automatically once a person enters to the chamber. The equipment is set up to take a 30-second reading of the respiration rate and generate a result at the conclusion of the 30th second. To identify this condition, system monitors the respiration rate of the individual using thermal image processing. Thus, a thermal camera is utilized in this system to measure the respiration rate while maintaining the contactless approach.

              <div class="entry-content">
                <p><br>This was an informative case research which made use of qualitative methods for data collection: semi-structured interviews and focus group 
                  discussions. We analyzed exiting e-learning providers, research papers regarding e-learning systems, Sri Lankan education and e-learning in Sri Lanka.
                   Complementary data was collected through analysis of relevant documents; Official documents from the government: Policies, reports, documents. 
                   Relevant internet resources: Web sites.</p>
                <p>Mentioned below are the four main components described in detail</p>
              </div>

              <h2 class="entry-title">
                <a>1. Get the relevant content from multiple websites according to a search keyword </a>
              </h2>

              <div class="entry-content">
                <p>In the proposed system there are two main users as teachers and students. Teacher can upload Tutorials and Lectures regarding 
                  each subject.  Students can view all the lectures and tutorials. If student wants to get more information than those included 
                  in the lectures and tutorials, he/ she has to use the search bar, in order to get relevant information from several websites 
                  in just one click. In here Mongo database is used to store lectures. So students can view the uploaded lectures.Using pattrn.
                  web python library get the most relevant websites and their content and title. Using regex tokenized the content of several 
                  websites. Tokenized content will be encoded using utf-8 format and fed to GPT-2 Language model. Because GPT-2 can’t understand 
                  tokenized input without encoding them. Then GPT-2 language model will generate relevant content. To convert human readable 
                  content, the content will be decoded.</p>

              <h2 class="entry-title">
                <a>2. Text summarization to find the most important sentences from a document​​ </a>
              </h2>

              <div class="entry-content">
               <p>Extractive text summarization is all about finding the most essential sentences from a document as a summary 
                 of that document. For this project, PageRank algorithm is used to find the most important sentences.</p>
               <p>The below mentioned steps were followed to get the most important sentences of a publish text document:</p>

              <div class="img-process"> 
              <img src="assets/img/Sumprocessflow.png" alt="" height="350" width="350">
              <p><i>Figure IV: Text summarization process flow</i></p>
              </div>

              <p>Sentence tokenization was performed to separate text document into sentences. Some sentences in text document do not 
                play any role in selecting relevant sentences of text for summary. Tokenization is the process of sentence segmentation 
                and possibly classifying sections of a string of input characters. It will produce a sentence list as a result and it 
                will passed on to some other form of processing.</p>

              <p>In this implementation, an object of CountVectorizer is being created that will be used for creating the document-term 
                matrix. TfidfTransformer is used for executing the method fit_transform() which provides the output as a normalized 
                document-term matrix (value 0-1) according to the Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). The word count in 
                the content can be found using TF-IDF vectorizer. The deficiency of a mere word count obtained from the CountVectorizer is 
                that, large counts of certain common words may dilute the impact of more context specific words in the corpus. 
                This is overcome by the TF-IDF vectorizer which penalizes words that appear several times across the document. 
                TF-IDF are word frequency scores that highlight words that are more important to the context rather than those that 
                appear frequently across documents.</p>

                <p>TF (Term Frequency): The no. of times a word appears in the current document (single sentence here)</p>
                <p>IDF (Inverse Document Frequency):  The no. of times a word appears in the entire corpus (Set of all sentences)</p>

                <div class="img-process"> 
                  <img src="assets/img/Sumtfidf.png" alt="" height="200" width="500">
                  <p><i>Figure V: TF-IDF</i></p>
                </div>

                  <p>After getting the normalized document-term matrix, a graph is required to be generated for the document, to apply PageRank algorithm. </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Each node represents a sentence</li>
                    <li>An edge represents that they have words in common</li>
                    <li>The edge weight is the number of words that are common in both of the sentences (nodes)</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>PageRank Algorithm helps to get the rank of every sentence of the document. Ranks is a dictionary with key=node 
                    (sentences) and value= PageRank (the rank of each of the sentences). Ranks will help to get the sentence array in 
                    descending order and by the largest score value and the smallest score value, the threshold can be calculated and 
                    get the summary of the document.</p>

                <a>3. Recommendation system for evaluate student’s educational level​​ </a>
              </h2>

              <div class="entry-content">
                <p>According to student answering the questions we assign rating for the each answering process. This rating measured based on the time 
                  taken to complete questions and the results of the questions. If the answer is the correct student get 60% rating from the model. 
                  Next 40% will be given by considering time duration that’s students spend for a one question. Using that rating process, model can 
                  identify each student’s difficult questions and easy questions. We categorise all the questions in the quiz server database, buy 
                  using that categorization model can easily pre-process the data. When the student get above 75% rating for a question in the relevant 
                  category, model identify that question easy for the student.</p>

                <p>Hence at the beginning, equal number of questions from all the lesson
                   will be given. As the time passes, the recommender system can identify the difficult lessons for the particular student and adjust the 
                   number of questions from each lesson. Hence the system will increase the number of questions from the difficult lessons and decrease 
                   the number in less difficult lessons.</p>
                
                <p>We want to identify the student’s rating for the each question. For that we use spare matrix. 
                   Using this matrix, model can easily identify student’s rating for the each questions and model can speed up the processing of that data. 
                   After the identify the difficult category of the student model recommended some more questions based on that category After calculating 
                   these rating difficult questions are recommended using a user-user recommender. This is done by finding similar users to the relevant 
                   user by using cosine similarity. After identifying similar users to the relevant user, difficult questions to those similar users are 
                   selected and filtered out in a way where the relevant user is always recommended by a new and a difficult question.​​ </p>

              <div class="entry-content">
               <p>When student type a question, importing NLTK library and using classification algorithms, the student’s question can be 
                 broken into getting all lemmas of the word, get related forms, Extract the words from the lemmas, get similar words from 
                 WordNet, remove duplicate words, convert singular nouns to plural and plural nouns to singular and then the system totals 
                 the number of counts. If the count exceeds fifty, the question transfers to the ontology process If not question will 
                 be e-mailed to the admin. </p>

                <p>Creating domain Ontology's purpose is to analyze the characteristics of similar field objects and the relationships 
                  between objects, then formulate them and store them in Ontology. This article has clarified the definition, say, and 
                  relationships between their properties by summing up the knowledge in "natural language processing." Protegé was used 
                  as a modeling tool in this paper to explain Ontology and build a detailed knowledge base on natural language processing
                   on the Ontology.   </p>
               
                <p>The main functions of the system are: using participle devices that combine with the user dictionary to handle user 
                  questions, including word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging; extracting keywords; extracting answers through J
                  ena reasoning; if the system has corresponding rules, it will provide an answer, and otherwise the system will provide 
                  knowledge navigation and the most relevant response from an Ontology. </p>

                  questions, including word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging; extracting keywords; extracting answers through 
                  Jena reasoning; if the system has corresponding rules, it will provide an answer, and otherwise the system will provide 
                  knowledge navigation and the most relevant response from an Ontology. </p>

                <p>Module Figure III of query analysis primarily involves word processing and retrieval of the keywords. The measures of 
                  problem interpretation are: segmentation of Chinese phrases. Part-of-talk tagging that combines with user dictionary. 
                  Getting the ingredients of a sentence through syntax analysis by Stanford Parser. Get Sequence of Keywords.</p>

                <p>The next step after an analysis of the questions is the retrieval of information on Ontology. In other words, the 
                  Response Extraction module transforms the problem into the Ontology query of the basic elements. In this paper, SPARQL 
                  language and Jena were adopted for the retrieval of Ontology information and the extraction of the reaction. Ontology 
                  extension includes primarily simultaneous extension, extension of the property, upper extension, under extension, 
                  extension of case, etc. To extend the query concepts, the father-son relationship of node and tree node is generally 
                  adopted. Since father-son relationship in the Ontology hierarchy is the most typical and open relation.  </p>
                

                <p>This method is very useful for answering questions in restricted domains dependent on ontology because it is 
                  possible to generate not only the question types, but also the query models, which in turn can be used to extract 
                  responses, based on a domain ontology. The approach set out above still has some drawbacks. The first is that the 
                  generated question patterns cannot address user questions of all kinds.  Particularly for a wide domain ontology 
                  containing too many groups and properties, exhausting different combinations of properties and creating all possible 
                  query patterns is challenging.</p>
