                  <a>About</a>
                </h2>
  
                <div >
                  <P>A full functioning web based e-learning system for the students to overcome obstacles of the education and to gain interest towards their studies. 
                      E-note learning system is a responsive web based system which is designed and developed for overcoming issues of traditional e-learning systems. 
                      Most e-Learning systems provide limited information using published documents in their database to e-learners. If a user wants to refer more than 
                      available documents to get more knowledge there is no certain process to satisfy that requirement. 
                      Current e-learning systems don’t give optimum solutions for this problem. From 'E-Note' learning system students can get knowledge 
                      not only from published documents but also can get information through the internet without reading and analyzing multiple websites.</p>
                      
                    <p>The product is designed and developed under four main components.</p>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Person Authentication</li>
                            <li>Cough Analysis</li>
                            <li>Body Temperature</li>
                            <li>Shortness of Breath</li>
                            <li>Anosmia Condition</li>
                            <li>Report Generation</li>

                        </ul>
                    </p>
                      <p><b>Person Authentication</b></p>
                      <p>Once someone walks into the chamber, the system detects them and starts the recognition process. The technology includes two approaches to identify the person. Face and voice recognition systems identify individuals and authorize the testing process to begin.</p>

                      <p><b>Cough Analysis</b></p>
                      <p>The technology is determining whether or not the captured audio comprises a cough. Following that, if the audio contains a cough, the system should be able to determine whether or not the cough is a COVID-19 positive cough.</p>

                      <p><b>Body Temperature</b></p>
                      <p>The basic purpose of fever detection is to take a non-contact temperature reading of the body. In this technique, a thermal camera is utilized to measure the body temperature.</p>

                      <p><b>Shortness of Breath</b></p>
                      <P>Using thermal image processing, the device monitors the individual's respiration rate. As a result, a thermal camera is used in this system to measure the rate of respiration. </P>

                      <p><b>Anosmia Condition</b></p>
                      <P>When the person enters the chamber, the system will ask a few questions about the odor. The collected results will be compared to the saturation level to determine whether or not the individual is a COVID-19 suspect. </P>

                      <p><b>Report Generation</b></p>
                      <P>A report is a very useful tool for management to utilize on a regular basis to track and analyze each employee/student. The person's name, identification number, and the daily results of the testing method are all included in the report.</P>

              <div class="entry-content">
                <p>'E-Note' Learning System is designed and implemented based on the four main components. The components are independent from each other 
                    in a functional level leading to several advantages. The most specific advantage can be considered as Model Switching which is the 
                    ability to train the same model with an aid of a different dataset of the same type under a brief amount of time depending on the 
                    related audience and most importantly without affecting other components. This can be highlighted as one of the biggest loopholes 
                    in the prevailing solutions. With a feature like Model Switching, the value of the product can be raised quality wise and as well as commercially.</p>
                  
                 <p>Since 'E-Note' learning system is implemented as a web hosted software, it is convenient for the users to work from any remote location. 
                     For the users who do not have enough technical knowledge, it is easy to work with the product because of the user adaptive system design 
                     and the user friendly interfaces. This product is designed considering the modern industrial trends such as work from home and bring your 
                     own device (BYOD) adding more value to the product. </p>

              <div class="entry-content">
                <p>'E-Note' is a machine learning-based single integrated hybrid learning system which is developed to e-learning purposes. 
                    The system is developed using High-Level Microservice Architecture therefore it is independently deployable. 
                    Following the global data standards is one main reason why 'E-Note' is a commercially valuable product. 
                    With the novel and smart technologies used in implementing 'E-Note' over 90% of accuracy is achieved. 
                    Throughout the design and development phase a lot of attention was given to reduce the resource consumption rate. 
                    Therefore, 'E-Note' is a cost-effective solution for any organization. The system is designed with user-friendly 
                    interfaces and comprehensive functions which are easier to handle without much IT knowledge. Role-Based Access Control 
                    along with one way authentication is used to prevent the system and its data to maintain high-level authentication. 
                    The higher processing speed of E-Note Learning System provides the ability to process the information quickly and 
                    without doing it consciously.</p>

                <p>With the
                  very rapid growth of technology, electronics and telecommunication, education conducted through
                 digital media is perceived to have many advantages and an increasing preference over traditional
                  education methods due to the improvements in the quality of education, the reduction in the cost
                  of education as well as the cost-effectiveness of the education, and the improvements in
                  accessibility to education and training.</p>
                  <p> Also given the current global and local CoVID19 pandemic situation,
                  where concepts such as remote working/ work-from-home, e-learning, online collaboration
                  platforms has become
                  exponentially growing and popular.</p>

                  <p><b>Organizations</b></p>
                  <p>It is out of debate that the Financial Institutions need to have a system for students to do their work. Financial Institutions are dealing 
                      with the hard-earned money of the general public and they are even charging for that purpose. Therefore, it is a high 
                      responsibility of them and as well adherence to provide a well e-learning platform. </p>
